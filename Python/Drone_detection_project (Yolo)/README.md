Input Layer: The input layer will take in the image of the frame with a size of 1920*1080 pixels.

Convolutional Layers: The convolutional layers will be used to extract features from the input image. You can start with a set of 3-4 convolutional layers, each with a small kernel size of 3x3 or 5x5. These layers will be followed by a max-pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2 to reduce the spatial dimensions of the output.

Flatten Layer: The output from the convolutional layers will be flattened and passed on to the fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layers: After flattening, you can add 2-3 fully connected layers with 128-256 neurons each.

Output Layer: The output layer will have two neurons, one for the x-coordinate and the other for the y-coordinate of the center of the drone.

Activation Functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function can be used for the hidden layers, and linear activation function for the output layer.

Loss Function: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function can be used to calculate the error between the predicted and actual coordinates of the drone.

Optimization Algorithm: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) can be used as the optimization algorithm to train the network.

Training Data: To train the network, you will need to create a dataset of frames with drones present and their corresponding coordinates. You can use image augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and translations to increase the size of the dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: You can use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the model.

Note: You may need to adjust the hyperparameters and the number of layers in the network based on the performance of the model during training and validation.



## EXAMPLE Code

Sure, here's an example implementation of the CNN in Python using TensorFlow:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the input shape
input_shape = (1920, 1080, 3)

# Create the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Convolutional Layers
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    # Flatten Layer
    Flatten(),
    
    # Fully Connected Layers
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    
    # Output Layer
    Dense(2, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mse', 'mae', 'rmse'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))

Note: The above code assumes that you have already prepared your training and validation data in the form of NumPy arrays, where train_images and val_images are arrays of image data, and train_labels and val_labels are arrays of corresponding drone coordinates. You will need to replace train_images, val_images, train_labels, and val_labels with your actual data. Also, you may need to adjust the hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate based on the performance of the model during training and validation.
